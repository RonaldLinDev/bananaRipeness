# Banana Ripeness Classification

## Project Overview

This project classifies the ripeness of a banana based on an image. Bananas are classified as unripe, ripe, overripe, rotten

Relevant Technologies: Tensorflow, Flask, sci-kit-image

## Installation 

Clone the repository
``` 
git clone https://github.com/RonaldLinDev/bananaRipeness
```
Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Server Locally
```
